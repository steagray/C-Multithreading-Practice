How to Run:
 The Makefile has 3 commands depending on which version of the program you'd like to run.
 
 In order to run the version with no synchronization, you would type "make nosync".
 In order to run the version with mutex locks, you would type "make locks".
 In order to run the version with TAS locks, you would type "make tas".
 The resulting file for each of these will be named just "threads."
